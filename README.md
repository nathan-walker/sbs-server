# Simple Blog Server

This is a CMS that I wrote for myself in Node.js and Express.

I probably wouldn't recommend anyone else use this code in production, since it was developed as more of a learning exercise. But I am using it myself to power [nwalker.org](http://nwalker.org).

This CMS uses Markdown files to store the post content, although an older version used a MongoDB database (look back in the commits).
