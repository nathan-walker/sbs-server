President Obama:

> What I’d like to do is to see the first two years of community college
> free for everybody who’s willing to work for it.  It’s something we can 
> accomplish, and it’s something that will train our workforce so that
> we can compete with anybody in the world.

Excellent news for the future.  Education is truly a gift that everyone should have access to.
