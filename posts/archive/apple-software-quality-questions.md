Jean-Louis Gassée, _Monday Note_:

> Last, there is the mixed bag of comparisons. One side of the coin is Apple’s numbers are splendid. The quarterly results that will be disclosed next week (January 27th) are likely to show strong iPhone 6 sales and a continuation of Mac progress. And despite my bug list, Apple software still compares favorably to Windows 8 and Android offerings.<br />
> The other view is that the quality lapses we observe are the beginning of a slide into satisfied mediocrity, into organizations and projects that “run themselves”, that are allowed to continue for political reasons without regard for the joy of customers.

Another perspective on the shift in Apple software quality.  While there isn't yet a consensus on the extent of the quality decline, it is clear that everyone in the Apple community sees a growing problem.
