I've been doing some research on codecs for screencasting, and based on my quality tests, the Apple Animation codec is the best overall.  If file size is not an object and the video will be edited further, ProRes 4444 is the best choice.  Also, if you are intending to share this video and don't mind slight quality loss, H.264 is the best option.  However, H.264 is not a good option if you intend on editing the clip.
