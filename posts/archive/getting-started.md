I'm doing <a title="NaNoWriMo" href="http://nanowrimo.org">National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)</a> again.  For those of you unfamiliar with it, NaNoWriMo is a program where you write a 50,000-word novel in a month.  Yes, it sounds crazy, and trust me, it is.

However, NaNoWriMo is actually one of the most rewarding experiences that you can have, because it uses a time constraint to force you to complete a big project that you probably never would have started otherwise.

Time is an excellent motivator.  Even if noveling isn't your thing, maybe try NaNoWriMo-style sprinting to accelerate your next big project.  Because the hardest part of a major project isn't doing the work, it's just sitting down and getting started.
