<blockquote>There are a thousand "no's"
For every "yes"
We simplify
We perfect</blockquote>

On Thursday, <a title="Apple Announces iPad Air 2" href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/2014-oct-event/">Apple announced the iPad Air 2</a>, featuring the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, an upgraded camera, and an even better screen.  They also announced a second new iPad.  If you were watching the keynote live, you might not have even noticed.  For about 30 seconds, Apple SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller slipped in a brief mention about the new iPad mini 3.  Some might wonder why Apple barely drew any attention to the smaller of their two tablets.  <!--more-->

The fact of the matter is that they simply didn't have anything to say about the iPad mini.  There are only two differences between the new iPad mini 3 and the old iPad mini 2 (formerly known as the iPad mini with Retina Display).  Touch ID and a gold option.  That's it.  No processor upgrade, no better camera.  Nothing. And Apple is selling the new iPad mini 3 for $100 more than last year's model.

Now, Touch ID is wonderful, and I'm really looking forward to using it on my next iPad.  However, no one would ever say that Touch ID is worth $100 extra.  Why would anyone in their right mind buy the iPad mini 3 over the iPad mini 2?  Why does the iPad mini 3 even exist?

<blockquote>We start to confuse
Abundance with choice
Designing something requires focus</blockquote>

To confuse things more, Apple also kept the original iPad Air and the original iPad mini (with its 2011-era A5 chip) in the lineup.  That brings the lineup to five different iPads.  With all the different cellular configurations, colors, screen sizes, and storage options, there are now almost 60 different iPad combinations to choose from.  When Steve Jobs first announced the iPad, there was one iPad, with only 6 different possible combinations.

What happened to simplicity?  Where were the "thousand 'no's'?"

I'm a pretty technical user, and to be honest, I had trouble figuring out the differences between the iPads and choosing which to buy when preorders started this week.  If I can't tell the difference, how can the average user?  We certainly have an abundance of iPads now, but do we really have that much choice?  In reality, only a handful of iPads are truly right for anyone to buy and will probably make up 90% of the purchases.

One of the things that allows Apple to make such great projects is that it keeps its engineering teams small.  Small teams have limits, and Apple seems to be pushing them too far.

So instead of releasing <a title="iOS 8 adoption slows" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/after-a-buggy-start-apples-ios-8-is-adopted-more-slowly-by-customers/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">unstable software</a> and <a title="iPad Mini 3: Probably the oddest and most boring product Apple has ever released - ExtremeTech" href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/192343-ipad-mini-3-probably-the-oddest-and-most-boring-product-apple-has-ever-released?">half-baked iPads</a>, it's time to start saying 'no' again.
