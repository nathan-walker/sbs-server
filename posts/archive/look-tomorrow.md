On the eve of WWDC, Apple's Tim Cook talks to Mashable's Christina Warren about the ongoing diversity efforts at Apple.

> I asked Cook about the lack of women at WWDC keynotes.  He smiled.  "Look tomorrow," he said.  "Look tomorrow and let me know what you think."

This development is very exciting to me, because Apple seems to have been quite behind on this issue compared to rivals like Microsoft and Google.
