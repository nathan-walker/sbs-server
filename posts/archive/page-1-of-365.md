It's fairly rare that I find myself inspired by one of the trending topics on Twitter.

However, on this New Year's Day 2015, I found myself gazing at "Page 1 of 365," which was one of the top trends this morning.  Over the past year or two&ndash;I'll admit it&ndash;I've neglected my blog quite a bit.  In the year 2013, I didn't post a single post, and in 2014, the posts were few and far between.  

I've taken a step in the right direction.  At the end of 2014, as you may have noticed, I completely revamped my blog CMS, switching from WordPress to a completely custom service that I built with Node, [Simple Blog Server](http://nwalker.org/simple-blog-server).  It's still a bit of a work in progress, but I promise that I will open-source it on GitHub one of these days.

Now that I have this great service for writing my blog, I'm going to start taking advantage of it.  In 2015, I am pledging to post to nWalker.org every day of the year.  Now, every day is not going to be a full 1000-word blog post.  In fact, most days it will probably just be a quick link somewhere or a note about the day's events.  But every day, there will be something.

This is page 1 of 365.  I can't wait to see where the year takes me.
