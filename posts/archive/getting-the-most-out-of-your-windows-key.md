Windows 8 is finally here, but do you know the best ways to get around the system?  In Microsoft’s latest operating system, the Windows Key got a lot more useful.  The Windows Key shortcuts in Windows 8 are sorted below into categories below.

<h2>Charms Shortcuts</h2>

In Windows 8, one of the key navigational concepts is the Charms Bar, located on the right side of the screen with navigation shortcuts.  You can quickly access Charms by pressing the following:

<strong>Win+C:  </strong>Opens the Charms Bar.

<strong>Win+Q:  </strong>Opens the Search Charm.

<strong>Win+H:  </strong>Opens the Share Charm.

<strong>Win:  </strong>Opens the Start Charm (Start Screen).

<strong>Win+K:  </strong>Opens the Devices Charm.

<strong>Win+I:  </strong>Opens the Settings Charm.  This charm is important as it is the only way to access the power controls.<!--more-->

<strong>Win+F:  </strong>Searches Files.

<h2>Launching and Controlling Apps</h2>

<strong>Win+TAB:  </strong>Opens the App Switcher on the the left side of the screen.
