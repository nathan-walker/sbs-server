Paul Ruderman, _Lifehacker_:


> People feel more empowered if they’re encouraged to contribute their own ideas. 
> They feel more ownership if their team ultimately incorporates some of their ideas. People rightly feel that their contributions are unique to them, and therefore, when their ideas are implemented, they feel more ownership in their team’s success. Nothing should be held in higher regard.

A nice complement to yesterday’s link from the New York Times.
