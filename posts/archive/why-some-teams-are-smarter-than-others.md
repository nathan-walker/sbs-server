Interesting piece from the _New York Times_ regarding the productivity of various groups.  It turns out that groups that promote the engagement of as many members as possible are most productive.

Also, this:

> Teams with more women outperformed teams with more men. Indeed, it appeared that it was not “diversity” (having equal numbers of men and women) that mattered for a team’s intelligence, but simply having more women. 

Worth a read.
