Hi, I'm Nathan.  I started this blog in December 2010 as a Tumblr site.  You can find those old posts [on Tumblr](http://tumblr.ncw.me).  The modern version of _The Moment_ started in October 2011 and initially started as a tutorial-focused site.  Today, _The Moment_ focuses on opinions and small status updates.

You can learn more about me on [my author page](http://nwalker.org/author/nathan).

## About This Site

This site runs on custom software called Simple Blog Server, or SBS.  SBS is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Nginx](http://nginx.org).  This site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com).  One of these days, I will publish SBS on GitHub as open-source, but it's not quite ready for public release yet.  

The public theme of this site runs on [Pure by Yahoo](http://purecss.io) and the [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) Merriweather and Lato.
